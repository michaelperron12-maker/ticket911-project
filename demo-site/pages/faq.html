            <div class="faq-q">What is Ticket911?</div>
            <div class="faq-a">
                Ticket911 is the largest AI-powered traffic ticket defense platform in North America. Founded in 2011, we specialize in fighting traffic tickets across three jurisdictions: Quebec, Ontario, and New York. Our team of experienced lawyers — including former prosecutors — combined with proprietary artificial intelligence technology, has resolved over 105,000 cases with a 90% success rate. We handle everything from speeding tickets to DUI charges, and our platform allows you to upload your ticket, get an AI analysis, receive a quote, pay online, and track your case in real time.

        <div class="faq-item">
            <div class="faq-q">How does Ticket911 work?</div>
            <div class="faq-a">
                The process is simple and can be completed entirely online. First, you scan or upload a photo of your ticket. Our AI analyzes it in under 30 seconds, identifying the violation, searching relevant legal databases, and calculating your chances of winning. You then receive a personalized quote by email and SMS. Once you accept and pay securely online, our lawyers review the AI-generated defense, build your case, and represent you in court. You can track everything through your personal client dashboard. In most cases, you never need to appear in court yourself.
            </div>
        </div>

        <div class="faq-item">
            <div class="faq-q">What areas do you serve?</div>
            <div class="faq-a">
                We serve three jurisdictions. In Quebec, we cover all of the province including Montreal, Laval, Longueuil, Quebec City, Gatineau, Sherbrooke, and surrounding areas. In Ontario, we serve the entire province including Toronto, Scarborough, Whitby, Mississauga, Ottawa, Hamilton, Kitchener, and more. In New York, we serve all five NYC boroughs: Manhattan, Brooklyn, Queens, the Bronx, and Staten Island. Our AI technology works across all three legal systems simultaneously.

        </div>

        <div class="faq-item">
            <div class="faq-q">Do I need to appear in court?</div>
            <div class="faq-a">
                In the vast majority of cases, no. Our lawyers appear in court on your behalf so you do not need to take time off work or travel to the courthouse. In Quebec and Ontario, we handle the full court representation. In New York, we handle Traffic Violations Bureau (TVB) hearings and other traffic court appearances. In rare circumstances involving serious charges (such as DUI or criminal driving offenses), your presence may be required, but your lawyer will inform you well in advance and prepare you thoroughly.

        <div class="faq-item">
            <div class="faq-q">What is the AI Ticket Analysis?</div>
            <div class="faq-a">
                Our AI Ticket Analysis is a proprietary artificial intelligence system that reads your traffic ticket (from a photo or scanned document), identifies the exact violation, determines the jurisdiction and applicable law, searches through seven legal databases (including CanLII, SOQUIJ, CourtListener, NYSCEF, and others), identifies relevant court precedents, and calculates your probability of successfully contesting the ticket — all in under 30 seconds. The AI reads tickets in French, English, and Spanish. It serves as the first step in building your defense, and its findings are then reviewed and refined by our human lawyers.
            </div>
        </div>

        <div class="faq-item">
            <div class="faq-q">How accurate is the AI?</div>
            <div class="faq-a">
                Our AI system has a 94% accuracy rate, which exceeds the performance of human lawyers in contract review tasks according to the LawGeex study. The AI is continuously trained on new court decisions, legal amendments, and case outcomes from our own 105,000+ case database. However, it is important to understand that the AI is a tool, not a replacement for legal judgment. Every AI analysis is reviewed by a licensed lawyer before any defense strategy is finalized. The combination of AI speed and human expertise is what delivers our 90% success rate.
            </div>
        </div>

        <div class="faq-item">
            <div class="faq-q">Is my data safe with the AI?</div>
            <div class="faq-a">
                Absolutely. We take data privacy extremely seriously. Our AI operates under a zero-retention policy, meaning your ticket data and personal information are not stored after the analysis is complete. All data transmission is protected by 256-bit SSL encryption, and our systems are PCI-DSS compliant. We do not share, sell, or use your data for any purpose other than analyzing your specific ticket. All information shared with our firm is also protected by solicitor-client privilege.

        <div class="faq-item">
            <div class="faq-q">Can AI replace a real lawyer?</div>
            <div class="faq-a">
                No, and it is not designed to. Our AI is a powerful analytical tool that accelerates the research and analysis phase of building your defense. It can search databases, identify patterns, and find precedents far faster than any human. But the strategic decisions — how to present your case, what arguments to make in court, how to cross-examine witnesses, and when to negotiate — require human judgment, courtroom experience, and legal expertise. That is why every case at Ticket911 is ultimately handled by a licensed lawyer. The AI makes our lawyers more effective, not less necessary.

        </div>

        <div class="faq-item">
            <div class="faq-q">How much does it cost?</div>
            <div class="faq-a">
                Our pricing is fixed and transparent — no hourly billing, no surprises. In Quebec, packages start at $199 for 0-3 demerit point tickets and go up to $699+ for serious offenses like DUI. In Ontario, packages start at $299 for minor offenses. In New York, NYC tickets start at $579. Every package includes AI ticket analysis, full legal representation, and court appearance by our lawyers. You can see all pricing details on our <a href="pricing.html" style="color:var(--accent); text-decoration:underline;">Pricing page</a>.
            </div>
        </div>

        <div class="faq-item">
            <div class="faq-q">What payment methods do you accept?</div>
            <div class="faq-a">
                We accept Visa, Mastercard, and American Express credit cards, Interac e-Transfer (for Canadian clients), bank transfer / ACH (for US clients), and we also offer payment plans where you can split the cost into 2-3 installments. All payments are processed through secure, PCI-DSS compliant systems with 256-bit SSL encryption. We accept both Canadian dollars (CAD) and US dollars (USD), with taxes calculated automatically based on your jurisdiction (TPS/TVQ for Quebec, HST for Ontario, NY Sales Tax for New York).

        </div>

        <div class="faq-item">
            <div class="faq-q">Is there a money-back guarantee?</div>
            <div class="faq-a">
                Yes. If we cannot improve the outcome of your ticket — meaning you end up with the same or worse result than if you had simply paid the original fine — you get your money back, minus a $100 administrative fee. This guarantee reflects our confidence in our team and our technology. Note that "improving the outcome" can mean a full dismissal, a reduction in fines, a reduction in demerit points, or an elimination of the conviction from your record. The specific terms of the guarantee are outlined in our service agreement.

            <div class="faq-q">Are there any hidden fees?</div>
            <div class="faq-a">
                No. The price you see on your quote is the price you pay. There are no hidden fees, no hourly add-ons, no surprise charges for court appearances, and no extra costs for AI analysis. Applicable taxes (TPS/TVQ, HST, or NY Sales Tax) are calculated and shown before you confirm payment. If your case requires an appeal or additional proceedings beyond the original scope, we will discuss this with you and provide a separate quote before proceeding.

            <div class="faq-q">Can I pay in installments?</div>
            <div class="faq-a">
                Yes, we offer payment plans for most packages. You can split your payment into 2 or 3 installments, depending on the total amount. The first installment is due at the time of signing, and remaining payments are scheduled at agreed-upon intervals. There is no interest or additional fee for using a payment plan. Contact our team at 1 (844) 440-9111 or through the online chat to set up a payment plan for your case.

        <div class="faq-item">
            <div class="faq-q">How long does the process take?</div>
            <div class="faq-a">
                The timeline varies by jurisdiction and court scheduling. In Quebec, most cases are resolved within 3 to 12 months, depending on the court's calendar. In Ontario, cases typically take 4 to 12 months. In New York, TVB hearings can be scheduled within 2 to 6 months. The initial steps — ticket upload, AI analysis, quote, and payment — can all be completed within minutes. Once you retain us, we file the necessary documents immediately. You can track the progress of your case in real time through your client dashboard.

            <div class="faq-q">What happens if I lose?</div>
            <div class="faq-a">
                If the court rules against you despite our best efforts, several things happen. First, our money-back guarantee kicks in if we were unable to improve the outcome of your ticket (you receive a refund minus the $100 admin fee). Second, depending on the case, we may recommend filing an appeal, which has its own separate process and fee structure. Third, your lawyer will explain exactly what the ruling means for you in terms of fines, demerit points, and insurance impacts, and advise you on next steps. You are never left in the dark.

        <div class="faq-item">
            <div class="faq-q">Can I contest a red light camera ticket?</div>
            <div class="faq-a">
                Yes, red light camera tickets can be contested. In fact, camera tickets often have strong defense possibilities. Common defenses include challenging the calibration of the camera, questioning the clarity of the photo evidence, disputing whether the light was functioning properly, and raising issues with the timing of the yellow-to-red interval. In Ontario, red light camera tickets do not carry demerit points but do carry fines, and contesting them can save you money. Our AI system specifically looks for camera-related defenses when analyzing your ticket.
            </div>
        </div>

        <div class="faq-item">
            <div class="faq-q">What about insurance impacts?</div>
            <div class="faq-a">
                This is one of the most important reasons to contest your ticket. A traffic conviction on your record can increase your insurance premiums by 15% to 40% or more, depending on the severity of the offense and your province or state. In Ontario, a speeding conviction can stay on your insurance record for 3 years. In Quebec, the SAAQ demerit point system can lead to license restrictions. By contesting and winning, you avoid the conviction entirely, which means no impact on your insurance. Even a reduction from a major to a minor offense can save you thousands in insurance costs over time.

        </div>

        <div class="faq-item">
            <div class="faq-q">How many demerit points before license suspension?</div>
            <div class="faq-a">
                The threshold varies by jurisdiction and driver status. In Quebec, a fully licensed driver faces suspension at 15 demerit points within a 2-year period, but new drivers (with a probationary license) face suspension at just 4 points. In Ontario, the threshold is 15 points for fully licensed drivers, 9 points for G2 holders, and 4 points for G1 holders. In New York, accumulating 11 points within 18 months results in license suspension. Each type of offense carries a different number of demerit points — speeding can range from 1 to 6 points depending on how far over the limit you were. Our AI calculates the exact demerit point risk for your specific ticket.

            <div class="faq-q">I got a ticket in another province, can you help?</div>
            <div class="faq-a">
                Currently, our licensed lawyers practice in Quebec, Ontario, and New York. If you received a ticket in another Canadian province (such as British Columbia, Alberta, or New Brunswick), we may not be able to represent you directly in court. However, we can still provide useful guidance: our AI can analyze your ticket to help you understand the charges and your options, and we can refer you to a trusted partner lawyer in your province. If you are a Quebec or Ontario driver who received a ticket in the other province, we can definitely help, as convictions often transfer between provinces and affect your home-province demerit points and insurance. Contact us at 1 (844) 440-9111 to discuss your specific situation.
